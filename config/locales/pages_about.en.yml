        <h4>Today’s Insufficient Authentication Methods</h4>

        <p>When deploying a web app you basically have three choices for how to protect
        administrative access:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Weak authentication: Passwords.</li>

          <li>Commercial strong authentication: Acquiring and supporting enterprise
            solutions like RSA SecurID, and/or the use of corporate PKI.</li>

          <li>Outsourced authentication: Oauth and ilk.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>None of these are suitable for many government organizations:</p>

        <p>Option 1, of course, is way too risky, but people do it anyway because at
        least they can.</p>

        <p>Option 2 is great if your organization already does it. But if not – and
        that's the case for the vast majority of state and local government
        organizations – it’s probably not financially feasible.</p>

        <p>Option 3 is undesirable on policy grounds because you can't rely on
        third-party services to protect administrative access to your government app.
        Also, Option 2 is considered best practice, and Option 3 falls short of it in
        some people's opinion.</p>

        <h4>The Common Services Framework Solution</h4>

        <p>We provide an option that uses the same underlying strong
        cryptography as Option 2, but without the cost. We’re using security technology
        that is already available, but not used because it is not packaged for ease of
        use, and not ready to be used with web apps.</p>
